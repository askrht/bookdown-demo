# Objective

Most of what I know about bookdown comes from what I learnt from [Yuhui](https://yihui.name/en/). The objective of this book is to make it easier for an R user to get started on bookdown. It assumes that you have a basic understanding of Unix tools like git, R, RStudio, HTML and CSS.

If you have any questions, I suggest that you read the [original book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) before googling.
